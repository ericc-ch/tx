Use pnpm as package manager.
Run `pnpm run check` after completing a task (typecheck and test per package; lint and format at workspace root).

## Workspace

- `packages/server` — CLI / library (`@tiket-tools/server`)
- `packages/extension` — browser extension (`@tiket-tools/extension`, WXT)

Node.js can run `.ts` (see `package.json`) files directly (no need for ts-node or tsx).

Never explicitly write types unless needed. Prefer type inference.

# References Directory

The `.references/` directory contains shallow clones of important external repositories.
Never make any changes in this directory, it is ignored by git and meant as reference only.

Prefer exploring and reading this directory over searching for documentation. Think of it as the source of truth.

Available references:

- effect-smol - Effect v4
